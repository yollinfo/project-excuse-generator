📝 **Instructions**
---
Create a simple website that generates random, hilarious excuses every time you refresh the page. Think of it as your ultimate “I’m sorry, but…” machine!

Here is an example: 
<img src="./assets/excuse.png" alt="excuse" width="800">

The idea is to randomly generate each part of a sentence, resulting in uniquely entertaining excuses!

### Hints:
- Start with your index.html by adding a single, hardcoded excuse. Verify that it displays correctly on your page.
- Add some basic styling with CSS to make your excuse generator visually appealing.
- In JavaScript, create separate arrays to hold different parts of the excuse (e.g., subjects, actions, objects, and timings).
- Use string concatenation to combine elements from these arrays into a complete excuse.
- Introduce randomness! Use JavaScript to pick random elements from each array to generate new excuses every time.
